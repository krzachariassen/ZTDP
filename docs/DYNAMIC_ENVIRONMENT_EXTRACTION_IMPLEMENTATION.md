# Dynamic Environment Name Extraction - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a dynamic, configurable environment name extraction system for the ZTDP AI-native platform that normalizes environment aliases to canonical names.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. EnvironmentConfig Structure
- **Configuration-driven approach**: All environment names and aliases are defined in a configurable structure
- **Default configuration**: Includes common environment names (development, staging, production, test, etc.)
- **Aliases support**: Each canonical environment name can have multiple aliases (e.g., "dev", "develop" → "development")
- **Case-insensitive**: Handles different cases (DEV, dev, Dev all resolve to "development")

### 2. Dynamic AI Prompt Generation
- **GetEnvironmentExamples()**: Dynamically generates AI prompt examples based on configured environments
- **GetApprovedEnvironmentsList()**: Creates a list of all approved environment names for AI reference
- **Configurable prompts**: AI prompts are no longer hardcoded but generated from configuration

### 3. Post-Processing Environment Names
- **ResolveEnvironmentName()**: Converts any alias to its canonical name
- **Graceful fallback**: Unknown environment names are returned as-is (allowing custom environments)
- **Normalization**: Ensures consistent environment naming across the platform

## Configuration Example

```go
EnvironmentConfig{
    ApprovedEnvironments: map[string][]string{
        "development": {"dev", "develop", "development"},
        "staging":     {"stage", "staging", "stg"},
        "production":  {"prod", "production", "live"},
        "test":        {"test", "testing", "qa"},
        "preprod":     {"preprod", "pre-prod", "preproduction"},
        "sandbox":     {"sandbox", "sbx", "demo"},
        "local":       {"local", "localhost"},
    },
}
```

## AI-Native Behavior

### Before (Hardcoded)
```go
// Static prompt with fixed examples
systemPrompt := `Examples:
- "staging environment" -> "staging"
- "production env" -> "production"`
```

### After (Dynamic)
```go
// Dynamic prompt generation
systemPrompt := fmt.Sprintf(`
IMPORTANT: Environment Name Inference Rules:
%s

Approved environment names: %s
`, s.config.GetEnvironmentExamples(), s.config.GetApprovedEnvironmentsList())
```

## Real-World Impact

### Input Normalization
- User says: "Create a development environment called dev"
- AI extracts: `environment_name: "development"` (canonical form)
- System creates: Environment named "development"
- Result: ✅ Consistent naming across the platform

### Alias Resolution Examples
- "dev" → "development"
- "prod" → "production" 
- "stage" → "staging"
- "qa" → "test"
- "DEV" → "development" (case-insensitive)
- "custom-env" → "custom-env" (unknown names preserved)

## Test Coverage

### Configuration Tests
- ✅ All alias-to-canonical mappings
- ✅ Case-insensitive resolution
- ✅ Dynamic prompt generation
- ✅ Custom configuration support

### Integration Tests
- ✅ End-to-end AI chat flows with real AI provider
- ✅ Environment name extraction and normalization
- ✅ Multi-scenario testing (dev, staging, production)

### Agent Tests
- ✅ All agent integration tests use real AI provider (no mocks)
- ✅ Business logic validation with normalized names
- ✅ Event-driven architecture with consistent naming

## Architecture Compliance

### Clean Architecture ✅
- **Domain Service**: Owns all business logic and AI extraction
- **Thin Agent Layer**: Simple delegation to domain service
- **Configuration**: Separate concern, easily testable
- **AI as Infrastructure**: AI provider is pure infrastructure tool

### Event-Driven ✅
- All operations emit structured events
- Environment names are normalized before event emission
- Consistent event payloads with canonical names

### Testability ✅
- Configuration is easily mockable/customizable
- Unit tests for all configuration logic
- Integration tests with real AI provider
- End-to-end scenarios validate complete flow

## Extensibility

### Adding New Environments
```go
config.ApprovedEnvironments["uat"] = []string{"uat", "user-acceptance", "acceptance"}
```

### Custom Configurations
```go
customConfig := &EnvironmentConfig{
    ApprovedEnvironments: map[string][]string{
        "alpha": {"a", "alpha"},
        "beta":  {"b", "beta"},
        "release": {"rc", "release-candidate", "release"},
    },
}
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation
- `/internal/environment/environment.go` - Added EnvironmentConfig and dynamic prompt generation
- `/internal/environment/environment_config_test.go` - Comprehensive configuration tests

### Test Updates
- `/internal/environment/environment_agent_test.go` - Fixed test expectations for normalization
- All agent integration tests now use real AI provider

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All environment names are normalized to canonical forms
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new environments and aliases
3. **AI-Friendly**: Dynamic prompts help AI understand context better
4. **Maintainable**: Configuration-driven approach reduces hardcoded values
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests
6. **Extensible**: Simple to customize for different deployment scenarios

## Future Enhancements

- Apply similar dynamic configuration to Service domain for service name extraction
- Add environment-specific validation rules
- Support for environment hierarchies (e.g., dev-feature-branch)
- Integration with external environment management systems
