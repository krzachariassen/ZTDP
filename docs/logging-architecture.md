# ZTDP Logging System Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Zero Touch Developer Platform's enhanced logging and event system.

## Overview

The ZTDP logging system provides real-time, structured event streaming with interactive web-based exploration capabilities. It transforms traditional log viewing into an interactive experience where users can explore events, understand system behavior, and gain insights through rich visualizations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Event Generation & Broadcasting

#### Backend Event Creation (`api/handlers/logs.go`)

The logging system creates structured events through the `createEventHandler()` function:

```go
func createEventHandler() func(eventType string, data []byte) error {
    // Creates rich, structured events with:
    // - Event categorization (Application, Deployment, Policy, Resource, Connection)
    // - Descriptive messages with emojis
    // - Full payload information
    // - Timestamp and metadata
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Categorization**: Events are automatically categorized based on payload content
- **Rich Messaging**: Events include descriptive text with contextual emojis (üéØ üöÄ üì¶ ‚úÖ ‚ùå üîí üîç üîß üóëÔ∏è)
- **Structured Data**: Every event includes full context, metadata, and structured payload

#### WebSocket Broadcasting (`internal/logging/realtime.go`)

The `BroadcastEvent()` method enables real-time event distribution:

```go
func (rt *RealTimeLogger) BroadcastEvent(eventData map[string]interface{}) {
    // Direct broadcasting of structured event data to WebSocket clients
    // Supports both regular logs and structured events
}
```

### 2. Real-time WebSocket Streaming

#### Endpoint: `/v1/logs/stream`

**Protocol Support:**
- **Regular Logs**: `{"type": "log.entry", "data": {...}}`
- **Structured Events**: `{"type": "event.structured", "data": {...}}`

**Event Structure:**
```json
{
  "type": "event.structured",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2024-12-09T10:30:00Z",
    "level": "info",
    "message": "üéØ Application checkout created successfully",
    "event_category": "Application Created",
    "event": {
      "type": "application.created",
      "source": "application",
      "subject": "checkout",
      "payload": { /* full event details */ }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Event Processing

#### WebSocket Message Handling (`static/graph-modern.html`)

The frontend distinguishes between regular logs and structured events:

```javascript
// Regular log handling
if (data.type === 'log.entry') {
    logsManager.addLogEntry(data.data);
}

// Structured event handling
if (data.type === 'event.structured') {
    logsManager.addStructuredEvent(data.data);
}
```

#### Interactive Log Display

**Features:**
- **Clickable Events**: Events with structured data are clickable and expandable
- **Rich Details**: Expanded view shows event type, source, subject, and full JSON payload
- **Visual Indicators**: Chevron icons indicate expandable content
- **Color Coding**: Different event types have distinct colors

#### Smart Filtering System

**Filter Categories:**
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- **Event Types**: Application Created/Updated/Deleted, Deployment Events, Policy Events, Resource Events, Connection Events
- **Components**: application, deployment, policy, resource, websocket, event-subscriber, logs-websocket, system
- **Free Text**: Search across all event content

```javascript
function matchesEventType(logData, filterValue) {
    // Smart categorization logic that matches events to filter categories
    // Based on event payload content and patterns
}
```

### 4. Visual Styling System (`static/graph-modern.css`)

#### Event Display Classes

```css
.log-expandable {
    /* Base styling for clickable log entries */
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
}

.log-event-type {
    /* Event type tags with color coding */
    padding: 2px 6px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    font-size: 0.8em;
}

.log-details {
    /* Expandable details container */
    max-height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition: max-height 0.3s ease;
}

.log-expanded .log-details {
    /* Expanded state */
    max-height: 500px;
}
```

#### Color Coding System

- **Application Events**: Blue tones (#007acc)
- **Deployment Events**: Green tones (#28a745)
- **Policy Events**: Orange tones (#fd7e14)
- **Resource Events**: Purple tones (#6f42c1)
- **Connection Events**: Teal tones (#20c997)

## Event Categories & Classification

### Automatic Event Categorization

Events are automatically classified based on payload analysis:

1. **Application Created/Updated/Deleted**: Events involving application lifecycle
2. **Deployment Events**: Service deployments, version updates, environment changes
3. **Policy Events**: Policy enforcement, validation, compliance checks
4. **Resource Events**: Infrastructure provisioning, configuration changes
5. **Connection Events**: WebSocket connections, client interactions

### Classification Logic

```javascript
// Example categorization patterns
if (payload.application || payload.app) {
    if (eventType.includes('created')) return 'Application Created';
    if (eventType.includes('updated')) return 'Application Updated';
    if (eventType.includes('deleted')) return 'Application Deleted';
}

if (payload.environment || payload.deployment) {
    return 'Deployment Events';
}

// Additional patterns for policy, resource, and connection events
```

## Usage Examples

### Accessing the Logging System

1. **Start the ZTDP API server**:
   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/api/main.go
   ```

2. **Open the web interface**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/static/graph-modern.html
   ```

3. **Generate events by interacting with the API**:
   ```bash
   # Create an application (generates Application Created event)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"metadata": {"name": "test-app", "owner": "team-x"}}'
   ```

### Event Exploration Workflow

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Events appear in real-time as they occur
2. **Filtering**: Use the filter controls to focus on specific event types or components
3. **Event Details**: Click on structured events to view full details
4. **Payload Analysis**: Examine JSON payloads to understand event context
5. **System Insights**: Use event patterns to understand system behavior

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Event Types

1. **Define Event Structure** in your handler:
   ```go
   eventData := map[string]interface{}{
       "type":    "your.event.type",
       "source":  "your-component",
       "subject": "your-subject",
       "payload": yourPayload,
   }
   ```

2. **Broadcast Event**:
   ```go
   rt.BroadcastEvent(eventData)
   ```

3. **Update Frontend Categorization** if needed in `matchesEventType()`

### Styling New Event Types

Add CSS rules for new event categories:

```css
.log-event-type.your-event-category {
    background-color: #your-color;
    color: white;
}
```

## Performance Considerations
