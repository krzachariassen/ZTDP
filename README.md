# Zero Touch Developer Platform (ZTDP)

ZTDP is a bold reimagining of the internal developer platform. It empowers you to deliver infrastructure and applications with **zero manual touch**‚Äîjust intent, contracts, and code. No YAML, no portals, no friction. ZTDP is built for the future: API-first, event-driven, and ready for both human and AI operators.

---

## üß† What Makes ZTDP Different?

- **Contract-Driven, Not YAML-Driven:** Express your intent in structured contracts‚Äîno more brittle YAML, no more static manifests.
- **Graph-Native Orchestration:** Every resource, dependency, and lifecycle is modeled as a live, queryable graph‚Äîenabling true dependency awareness and incremental updates.
- **Composable, Pluggable Resource Providers:** Add new infrastructure types or swap backends without changing the core platform.
- **Event-Driven, Not Pipeline-Driven:** ZTDP is built on an event bus, not a pipeline runner‚Äîenabling real-time, auditable, and autonomous operations.
- **AI-Ready by Design:** Structured, deterministic, and safe for both human and AI agents to operate‚Äîno hidden state, no magic.
- **API-First, TDD-First:** Every feature is built and tested as an API from day one, with a focus on developer experience and automation.
- **Zero Touch, Zero Friction:** From contract submission to deployment, ZTDP eliminates manual steps, portals, and glue code‚Äîjust outcomes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Local Dev)

ZTDP is designed for rapid iteration and local hacking. You can be up and running in minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Go 1.23+

### Quickstart

```bash
# Start Redis for backend storage
docker-compose up -d

# Set environment variables
export ZTDP_GRAPH_BACKEND=redis
export REDIS_HOST=localhost:6379
export REDIS_PASSWORD=BVogb1sEPqA  # matches docker-compose.yaml

# Run a control plane demo (optional, to pre-populate sample data)
go run ./test/controlplane/graph_demo.go

# Or start the API server
go run ./cmd/api/main.go
```

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality

We live and breathe TDD and API-first development:

- Every feature starts with a test.
- Logic and contracts are covered (`go test ./...`).
- APIs are tested with HTTP assertions.
- Redis-backed graph is tested for both in-memory and persistence.

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...
```

## üèóÔ∏è Example API Usage (with curl)

### 1. Create Environments
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/environments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metadata": { "name": "dev", "owner": "platform-team" },
    "spec": { "description": "Development environment" }
  }'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/environments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metadata": { "name": "prod", "owner": "platform-team" },
    "spec": { "description": "Production environment" }
  }'
```

### 2. Create Application
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metadata": { "name": "checkout", "owner": "team-x" },
    "spec": {
      "description": "Handles checkout flows",
      "tags": ["payments", "frontend"],
      "lifecycle": {}
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Allow Application to Deploy to Environments
```bash
# Allow checkout app to deploy to dev
dev_env="dev"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/environments/$dev_env/allowed

# Allow checkout app to deploy to prod
prod_env="prod"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/environments/$prod_env/allowed
```

### 4. Create Services for the Application
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metadata": { "name": "checkout-api", "owner": "team-x" },
    "spec": {
      "application": "checkout",
      "port": 8080,
      "public": true
    }
  }'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metadata": { "name": "checkout-worker", "owner": "team-x" },
    "spec": {
      "application": "checkout",
      "port": 9090,
      "public": false
    }
  }'
```

### 5. Deploy Services to Environments
```bash
# Deploy checkout-api to dev
deploy_service="checkout-api"
deploy_env="dev"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/services/$deploy_service/environments/$deploy_env

# Deploy checkout-api to prod
prod_env="prod"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/services/$deploy_service/environments/$prod_env

# Deploy checkout-worker to dev
worker_service="checkout-worker"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/services/$worker_service/environments/$deploy_env
```

### 6. Attempt to Deploy Service to Not-Allowed Environment (Should Fail)
```bash
# Remove prod from allowed environments for checkout (replace allowed list with only dev)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/environments/allowed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '["dev"]'

# Try to deploy checkout-worker to prod (should fail with 403)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/applications/checkout/services/checkout-worker/environments/prod -v
```

## üîÑ Regenerating Swagger Docs

After updating handler annotations, run:

```bash
swag init -g api/server/server.go
```

## üîê Secrets & State (Planned)

- Secrets will be stored per environment and injected at runtime.
- State (events, node status) will be tracked in Redis initially.
