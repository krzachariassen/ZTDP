# AI-Native Policies Implementation Backlog

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

Complete refactoring of ZTDP's policy system to implement AI-native governance that follows clean architecture, domain-driven design, and test-driven development principles.

### **Core Principles**
- **Clean Architecture**: Business logic in domain services, AI as infrastructure tool
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write failing tests first, then implement
- **KISS**: Keep it simple and straightforward
- **Metadata-Based**: Store policy evaluations in graph metadata, never block operations

## üèóÔ∏è **New Architecture Vision**

### **Current Problem**
- Policies only apply to edge creation (`AddEdge`)
- Hard blocking approach loses user intent
- Limited to simple rule-based evaluation
- No AI intelligence or context awareness

### **Target Solution**
```
User Action ‚Üí Graph Operation ‚Üí Policy Evaluation (AI) ‚Üí Metadata Annotation ‚Üí Event Emission
```

**Key Changes**:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Policies apply to nodes, edges, and graph-level operations
2. **Metadata Storage**: Policy results stored in metadata, operations never blocked
3. **AI-Driven Evaluation**: Natural language rules with intelligent context analysis
4. **Event-Driven Workflow**: Policy violations trigger workflows and approvals

## üìù **Detailed Test-Driven Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: Write All Failing Tests First**

#### **Test File Structure**
```
internal/policies/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service_test.go           # Main policy service tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_policies_test.go     # Node-level policy tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edge_policies_test.go     # Edge-level policy tests  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graph_policies_test.go    # Graph-level policy tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai_integration_test.go    # AI provider integration tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store_test.go            # Policy store tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_test.go         # Workflow integration tests
```

#### **Key Test Scenarios to Implement**

**Node Policy Tests:**
```go
func TestNodePolicy_ApplicationServiceLimit(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: Applications cannot have more than 10 services
    // Should: Create app with 11 services, verify policy violation in metadata
}

func TestNodePolicy_DatabaseBackupRequired(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: Database resources must have backup configuration
    // Should: Create database without backup config, verify policy violation
}

func TestNodePolicy_SecurityConfiguration(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: Production services require security configuration
    // Should: Create production service without security, verify violation
}
```

**Edge Policy Tests:**
```go
func TestEdgePolicy_NoDirectProdDeployment(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: Applications cannot deploy directly to production
    // Should: Create deploy edge to prod, verify blocked status in metadata
}

func TestEdgePolicy_CrossEnvironmentAccess(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: Services cannot access resources in different environments
    // Should: Create cross-env connection, verify policy violation
}
```

**Graph Policy Tests:**
```go
func TestGraphPolicy_MaxApplicationsPerCustomer(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: Maximum 5 applications per customer
    // Should: Create 6 applications, verify policy violation
}

func TestGraphPolicy_EnvironmentCoverage(t *testing.T) {
    // Test: All applications must be deployed to at least one environment
    // Should: Create app without deployment, verify policy violation
}
```

## üî¨ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Test-First Development Process**

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for each epic/story
   ```bash
   go test ./internal/policies/... -v
   # Should see all tests fail with "not implemented" errors
   ```

2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
   ```bash
   go test ./internal/policies/... -v
   # Should see tests pass with basic implementation
   ```

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve implementation while keeping tests green
   ```bash
   go test ./internal/policies/... -v
   # Should maintain passing tests with improved code
   ```

### **KISS Implementation Guidelines**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with in-memory implementations
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each function/method has one clear purpose
3. **Clear Naming**: Use domain language that business understands
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only inject what's absolutely needed
5. **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and provide clear error messages

### **AI Integration Pattern**

```go
// CORRECT: Domain service owns business logic, AI as infrastructure tool
func (s *PolicyService) EvaluateNodePolicy(ctx context.Context, node *graph.Node, policy *Policy) (*PolicyEvaluation, error) {
    // 1. Business validation first
    if err := s.validateNodeForPolicy(node, policy); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    // 2. Try AI evaluation if available
    if s.aiProvider != nil {
        evaluation, err := s.evaluateWithAI(ctx, node, policy)
        if err == nil {
            return evaluation, nil
        }
        // Log AI failure but continue with fallback
        s.logger.Warn("AI evaluation failed, using fallback", "error", err)
    }
    
    // 3. Fallback to rule-based evaluation
    return s.evaluateWithRules(node, policy)
}
```
