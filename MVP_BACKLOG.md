  - [ ] Minimal RP that provisions a Postgres DB
- [ ] **Secrets Management (Basic)**
  - [ ] Store and inject secrets for RPs
- [ ] **Event Bus Integration**
  - [ ] Use NATS for event dispatch (replace direct calls)
- [ ] **State Store**
  - [ ] Persist node/event state in Redis
- [ ] **Reconciliation Loop**
  - [ ] Detect drift and trigger reconcile events
- [ ] **Event Store (Pluggable Resource Provider)**
  - [ ] Minimal RP that captures all platform events and operation logs
  - [ ] Allow custom implementations for compliance/integration

## Phase 3: Developer Experience & Docs

- [ ] **Swagger/OpenAPI Docs**
  - [ ] All endpoints documented and browsable
- [ ] **Local Dev Environment**
  - [ ] Docker Compose for Redis, Postgres, NATS
- [ ] **README & Usage Docs**
  - [ ] Example Application/Service/Environment, API usage, and ‚Äúhow to run demo‚Äù

**How to use:**  
- Work top-down: Don‚Äôt start Phase 2 until Phase 1‚Äôs end-to-end flow works.  
- Each item should be a PR/ticket.  
- Demo early and often!
