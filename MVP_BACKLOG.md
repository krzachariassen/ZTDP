# ZTDP MVP Backlog

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: API Testing & AI Deployment Analysis (June 9, 2025)

### üéØ Major Achievement: Complete API Validation
- **‚úÖ All API tests passing** - 16/16 tests in `/test/api/api_test.go` 
- **‚úÖ Platform setup validated** - Applications, services, environments, resources, policies
- **‚úÖ Clean architecture confirmed** - Proper separation of API/domain/infrastructure layers
- **‚úÖ Test stability achieved** - Consistent results across multiple runs

### üîç Critical Discovery: AI Deployment Gap
- **Issue**: V3Agent creates contracts but doesn't execute actual API calls
- **Impact**: Users expect AI to perform deployments, not just plan them
- **Solution needed**: AI-to-API execution bridge

## üî• CURRENT PRIORITY: AI-to-API Execution Bridge

### Next Critical Task
**Goal**: Make V3Agent actually execute deployments instead of just creating contracts

**Implementation needed**:
```go
// Add to V3Agent
func (a *V3Agent) executeAction(action string, params map[string]interface{}) error {
    switch action {
    case "deploy":
        return a.callDeploymentAPI(params["app"], params["environment"])
    case "create_application":
        return a.callApplicationAPI(params)
    }
}
```

### Success Criteria
- User says "Deploy checkout-api to Dev" ‚Üí Actual deployment occurs
- AI-based test creates identical platform state as API tests
- Natural language interface fully replaces API calls for common operations

**How to use:**  
- Work top-down: Don‚Äôt start Phase 2 until Phase 1‚Äôs end-to-end flow works.  
- Each item should be a PR/ticket.  
- Demo early and often!
